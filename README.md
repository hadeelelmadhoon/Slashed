Slashed is a YHack 2018 Hackathon project created at Yale University.

It is a platform for students to find nearby restaurants that offer discounts. Now it's easier than ever to find a new favorite place to eat, and get together with your friends.

The current version offers information about restaurants in the New Haven area, near Yale, as it is targetted to Yale students.

It is created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (all in one file for easy sharing of the file during fast paced group work), using Google Maps API, Google Geolocation API and Google Heat Maps to demonstrate popularity of different restaurants.

Each restuarant location has information in an infowindow about discount amount and hours of operations. There is also a feature to send a facebook message to invite friends to restaurants straight from the map.
